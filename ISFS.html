        ISFS is a collaborative project deploying an intervention for a space that enables strangers to interact. 
        This project allowed us to influence, engage, and interact with systems through the user’s lens. 
        This 3 week project created a new perspective on public spaces through 3 different iterations.

      <h1>RESEARCH</h1>
      <!-- <div class="subSec">Location</div> -->
      <p>
            My team and I decided to create an intervention at Columbus Park in Chinatown. We hypothesized that this location would give us the most interesting and un-expecting interactions because of the concentrated ethnic group there.

      <h1>Process</h1>
      <!-- <div class = "subSec"> Iteration A</div> -->
      <div class="subhead2">
        Through 3 iteration, we were able to design and prototype the 3 seperate
        interventions within the park.

      <div class="photo8"><img src="img/notes.png" width="200" /></div>

      <div class="overview2">
        <b>Problem</b>: We noticed that the
        elders would smoke, then throw the cigarette butts on the ground. It
        was interesting to see this because the park had approximately 6-10
        trashcans located around every curve. <br /><br />
        <b>Solution</b>: In response to the debris and litter on the ground, we
        wanted to create ash trays located at every table. By using recyclable materials, 
        we reconstructed these soda cans into ash trays by cutting strips and folding the metal.
      </div>

      <div class="overview3">
        As a team, we synthesized our insights in an affinity map in order to
        narrow our scope. We identified key themes in our process. This was a
        form of brainstorming during the earlier stages that proved to be
        helpful in setting up a good foundation for the entirety of the project.

<h1>TAKEAWAYS</h1>

<p class = "takeaways">⟶ Elder don’t like change.<br>

       ⟶ Sustainability isn’t prioritized<br>
     
       ⟶ Enjoys familiarity in community
     <br>
        ⟶ Project was an evident “interruption” to their routine through them knocking it down
        <br>
        ⟶ Their interaction gave us a sense of direction for the next iterations</p>


<p class = "challenges">     Challenges we encountered were verbally 
        speaking to them or  feeling out of place due to cultural norms. My team and I decided that we 
        should try to reach a new target group due to more technical issues. As a result, we transitioned to
        another part of the park: the playground.</p>

 <h1>REDESIGN</h1>

<!-- <P class = "redesign">After several rounds of critique, we shifted towards children as the 
    new target audience. We predicted that this shift in design will give us much better yet 
    unpredictable interaction. Observing children interaction was energetic and interesting. Through 
    this, we learned that children were more likely to act on their curiosity rather than elders.</P> -->

    <div class="subSec">Outcome</div>

    <P class = "redesign">The outcome was un-expecting yet exciting. As soon as we set down
     the boxes, a crowd of young children gathered around and immediately 
     began stacking, throwing, sitting on, and chasing each other with the 
     boxes. The interaction gave us insight into behavioral analysis of kids, specific to this location.</P>

     <P class = "redesign">Our key concept for this final iteration was the <u>“exquisite corpse.”</u> We 
     wanted the children to focus on the boxes and treat it as if it had more meaning 
     than the blank cubes before. We created 8 character faces, 8 torsos, 8 lower bodies, 
     as well as 4 hats. We also included orange into our color scheme to allow the top, middle, 
     and bottom concept of three to flow better.</P>
