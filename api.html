     <h1>REFLECTION</h1>
     <p class = "redesign">I was able to explore various data driven websites by using a weather API. At first, I struggled with 
         troubleshooting pulling the data from the actual weather site. However, I was able to try different methods of pulling data 
         and as a result was able to create this website. My intention with the visual design was to recreate an older looking newspaper.
         I think I was successful visually, but through feedback, I could've incorporated more text to follow the theme of a "newspaper article." (ノ・∀・)ノ
