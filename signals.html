      <div class="overview">
            Facial expression is a form of <b>representation and communication</b>.
             When we have certain emotions, we want to express it to others. For some, 
             it may not be quite as easy to physically portray how you feel. This project 
             was a study aimed to explore our representation of emotion through a method of 
             communication. Towards the end of this experience, the participants will see the
              symbolism in the colors and hopefully will become more aware about how they portray 
              their emotions through technology.</b>

<h1>Understanding the code</h1>

<div class = "overview">Through several iterations, I was able to finalize 
    the code for Processing and match the mesh points in the Face OSC 
    program. Once I got the facial data to communicate with Processing, 
    I had to focus on Processing communication with Arduino. With Arduino, 
    I used a 35mm LED pixel strip that changed colors based on my facial 
    data and the color of the processing sketch.</div>

     <h1>REFLECTION</h1>
     <P class = "redesign">This is one of my favorite projects I've worked on during my time at DT. I was able
          to explore not only my technical abilities, but it gave me an opportunity to experiment, communicate, and represent.
        I'm hoping to bring this idea out further, 
         into the real world. Currently, I'm continuing to work on this project by 
         recreating the immersive headpiece and tailoring it to a more specific audience. 
         I want people to be able to utilize this technology as a way of representing their 
         emotions to those who may not be able to.
