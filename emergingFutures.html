        Studies of envisioning an emerging technology

      <div class="overview">
        Using a method of research and inquiry, I created a study of exploration around 3D printing as my emerging technology.
        I was able to explore the potential cascading impact of an emerging technology through a series of studies, workshops, and discussions 
        using design to better understand the technology. After researching the topic as a whole, I was able to specify my studies: <b>Medical applications with 3D printing.</b>

      <div class="overview">
        3D Printing is a new and emerging technology that is applied to all aspects of our lives. Whether it's housing, food, work, construction, auto-manufacturing, 3D printing is found at the 
        core of these industries. I created a data map that gave me a clearer insight into which direction I wanted to take and how I could
        go about taking those steps.

      <h1>2D Study</h1>
      <!-- <div class = "subSec"> Iteration A</div> -->
      <div class="overview">
            Initially, I chose to create a menu that informs 
            people of what fast food menus could look like in the future. In the future, 
            the possibilities are limitless when it comes to emerging technologies such as 3D 
            printing. Design wise, I wanted to create a playful yet futuristic look of what our
             food system could one day be: printing food instantaneously for the user. This 2d 
             study relates to my topic because 3d printing is an applicable source utilized in 
             various industries and can promote creativity while speeding up the process: one of
              these industries being the food industry. Today, research is being done to print small 
              scale foods such as chocolate and meat. I could see the future as people living off of 3d printed foods, 
              especially in situations of natural disaster relief and more. When people look at my menu, I want them to 
              think this menu is humorous yet frightening of what our future can look like through a physical menu. Overall, I 
              think this menu can give us insight of our future through 3D printing in the food industry.

<h1>3D Study</h1>

<div class = "overview">My study revolved around the medical aspect of kidney transplants today. 
    I've created a game experience that shows the reality of what it's like waiting for a kidney 
    and how various factors(whether financial, death, infection, etc) affect the process of receiving 
    a kidney and performing the procedure. My intention with this game was to be more playful and less 
    intimidating, since this topic can carry alot of emotions and sadness. I decided to 3d print the 
    Donor and Patient pieces, blue and red dice with blood types, and two kidneys. Overall, I think it
     was somewhat successful but could've been thought out better in terms of being an actual game that 
     is playable.</div>

 <h1>Emerging Futures II</h1>


    <P class = "redesign">
        I wanted to continue with the idea of a game for my next iteration, so I decided to transition from a board game to a simpler card game.
        For this iteration, I was inspired by the idea of storytelling when people are in urgent medical 
        situations – more specifically, in line for a transplant. Through interviews with 
        people who've had some form of organ transplant, I've learned that patients are not only affected, but friends and families.
        Also, the concept of chance and matching is a relevant theme in this game because of the reality of having
        to find a match for a transplant and the fluctuation of chances in this "game" of receiving an organ transplant.

     <div class="subSec">How to Play</div>
     <P class = "redesign"> This is a game for 2+ Players about storytelling with constraints.
         Each player has the same deck of 32 cards, all with abstract and literal illustrations on them.
         The role of "storyteller" gets passed after each round. You have to put down 3 cards faced down
         and flip over a topic card. You look at your first card and begin to tell a story revolving around the topic 
         card you flipped over. </P>
         <div class="subSec">Objective</div>
         <P class = "redesign">
             Generate a creative story so the other players can match your cards.The goals is for the other players to guess the card you are describing by shuffling through 
             their deck in time. The same concept applies throughout the entire game. 
         </P>
        <div class="subSec">Scoring</div>
        <P class = "redesign">If the players guess all three of your cards, then they each get 3 points and the storyteller gets 0 points.
            If the players guesses 2 of the cards, then they get 2 points. If they get 0, then the storyteller gets 1 point.The first player to get 15 points wins!

     <h1>REFLECTION</h1>
     <P class = "redesign">I enjoyed working on this project because it gave me great insight into what the 
     reality of understanding organ tranplants was, along with the many factors that come with the proccess. 
     I was also able to understand how powerful one machine can be to our society and the impact it can have, whether positive or 
     negative. This project has sparked my interest in the game industry and I will continue to iterate on it. ⊂(◉‿◉)つ
